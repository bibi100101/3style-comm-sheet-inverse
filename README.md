download your sheet as a .csv, put the file path in the main.py an then import the out.csv into your sheet
the sheet must have a row and a collumn before the actuall comm part (so the comm for AA starts at B2)

supports normal and slash comms but you need to have [] included. it will ignore algs so you need to write them yourself
